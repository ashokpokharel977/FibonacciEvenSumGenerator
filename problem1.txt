Algorithm to solve even sum generator of a Fibonacci sequence
1. Define the limit in this case it's four Million
2. If the limit is 2 return 0 since there is no even terms in first two numbers
3. Initialize the first two even numbers to begin with and add it and assign to sum
4. Calculate the sum until the limit
5. Calculate the next even number using F(n+1) = F(n) + F(n-1) .
6. Return the sum
 
Additional statements
1. If the limit is taken as input function complexity is as:
    Time complexity : O(n)
    Space complexity : O(1)
2. Test 
    fibEvenSum() == 4613732 (for four Million limit)
    Since there are no user input no error occurs
